# Avoid Everything Dev Container

This directory contains the development container configuration for the Avoid Everything project.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker** with NVIDIA Container Toolkit for GPU support
2. **VS Code** or **Cursor** with Dev Containers extension
3. **X11 forwarding** set up on your host (for GUI applications)

## Quick Start

### Using VS Code/Cursor
1. Open the project folder in VS Code/Cursor
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and start

### Using Docker Compose directly
```bash
# Build and start the container
docker-compose up -d

# Attach to the running container
docker-compose exec avoid-everything-dev /bin/bash
```

## What's Included

- **CUDA 12.1.1** development environment
- **Python 3** with scientific computing packages
- **OMPL** (Open Motion Planning Library)
- **PyTorch** with CUDA support
- **Development tools**: cmake, git, neovim, etc.
- **GPU access** for CUDA workloads
- **X11 forwarding** for GUI applications

## Environment Variables

- `PYTHONPATH=/workspace` - Your project is automatically in the Python path
- `DISPLAY` - Forwarded from host for GUI apps
- NVIDIA GPU variables configured automatically

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Applications Not Working
Make sure X11 forwarding is enabled on your host:
```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

### GPU Not Accessible
Verify NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed:
```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
```

### Container Won't Start
Check Docker Compose logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs avoid-everything-dev
```
